# Messaging Program
****Messaging Program**** This is a personal project that I started in July 2019. I wanted to learn more about socket communication 
in Java, so I followed a basic tutorial and then implemented my own additional features from there. I hope to keep building on this
project with more essential features of typical messaging apps and a functioning GUI. 

## How To Run The Program
To run the program, first run the server file. Then, run the client file. If you haven't used this program already, you'll have to 
create an account by typing in 'SIGN UP'. Special phrases are needed for the program to work so when you see something like 
"Would you like to sign up or login [SIGN UP | LOGIN]" the [SIGN UP | LOGIN] notation is indicating to you the correct phrase you'll
need to type for either option. Once you've created a username and password, you'll be able to 'ADD' friends to your friends list. Once
you've added friends to your friends list, you're able to 'CHAT' with your friends. Once you select the option to chat with your
friends, your friends list will pop up and you'll be able to chat with any of them. If you try to chat with someone that's not in 
your list, it'll give you the option to either add them as a friend or chat with someone else. Once you're chatting with a friend, 
you're able to logout anytime by typing 'LOGOUT'. At that point, the socket connection will be terminated for that client/user and it
will alert the friend/other client you were chatting with that you have logged out and that they will need to log back in again in
order to chat with someone else.
